# CSS Syntax

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

The **selector** points to the HTML element that you want to style.

The **declaration block** contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each **declaration** includes a CSS **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon.

Multiple declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
