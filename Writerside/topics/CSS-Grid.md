The CSS Grid is a module that brings a two-dimensional layout system to CSS.

CSS Grid works perfectly together with flexbox, which is best to handle one-dimensional components and layouts.

- **gutter**: the actual space between the rows and the columns.
- **grid track/row**: the space between two grid lines, no matter if it is vertical or horizontal.
